Git reset is used to go back to an earlier commit and remove or unstage changes from the current history.
git reset --soft	Undo commit but keep changes staged.
git reset --mixed	Undo commit and unstage changes (default).
git reset --hard	Undo commit and delete all changes completely.

example:
git reset --soft HEAD~1
➡️ Removes last commit but keeps your work safe.
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
➡️ Removes the last commit and unstages the changes, but keeps the work in your files.
