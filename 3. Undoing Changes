Git reset is used to go back to an earlier commit and remove or unstage changes from the current history.
git reset --soft	Undo commit but keep changes staged.
git reset --mixed	Undo commit and unstage changes (default).
git reset --hard	Undo commit and delete all changes completely.

example:
git reset --soft HEAD~1   ➝ Removes last commit but keeps changes staged.
git reset --mixed HEAD~1  ➝ Removes last commit and unstages changes, but keeps files.
git reset --hard HEAD~1   ➝ Removes last commit and deletes all changes completely.

Git revert safely undoes a commit by making a new commit that cancels the previous changes but it keeps the history straight.
